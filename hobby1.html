<H3>League of Legends</H3>
I've played League on and off since I first got a PC in 2013. I recently started playing it after years of not touching the game in 2021 but then completely stopped during 2024.
I've picked it up again this year to play with my friends. I play mostly mid lane but sometimes I will play top or bottom lane. I also used to play jungle but I have not touched it this year.
My favorite champions are kayle, syndra, vladimir, and ekko for mid/top lane and jinx when I play adc. I also played ekko, kindred, and shyvana when I used to play jungle. 
I like playing scaling champions that get very powerfull during the late game stages.
<H3>Indie Games</H3>
I enjoy playing Indie Games on steam from time to time. Some of my favorites include Hollow Knight, Ori and the Blind Forest, The Messenger, Touhou Luna Nights, and Risk of Rain 2
<H3>PlayStation Games</H3>
I bought a PS5 during freshmen year (2021) mainly to play a game called Ghost of Tsushima. I also play Elden Ring on my PS5.
