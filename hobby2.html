<H3>Eastern WebNovels</H3>
My interest in ProgressionFantasy first started with Eastern webnovels. The first novel I really liked was the Japanese light novel Overlord by Kugane Maruyama and I got into it after finishing the anime and wanting to continue the story.
Other Japanese webnovels I read are Classroom of the Elite and Jobless Reincarnation. I then eventually started reading Korean Webnovels like Solo Leveling, The Second Coming of Gluttony, and Overgeared (my favorite of the three).
Eventually I also read some chinese cultivation webnovels like Reverend Insanity and Lord of the Mysteries (although I never finished it).
<H3>Western Webnovels</H3>
After reading a lot of Eastern Progression Fantasy Webnovels I started delving into western stories. Although it is a fairly new genre in the western scene. Stories like Defiance of the Fall, The Perfect Run, and Cradle have been very enjoyable.
